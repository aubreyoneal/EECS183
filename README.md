EECS 183 is an intensive introductory programming course at the University of Michigan. I have provided my 6 xcode projects completed during
Fall 2014. Projects and languages taught vary each year, so my work may help understand certain functions, but will not solve your homework.
Projects 1-5 are in C++ and Project 6 is in Python.
